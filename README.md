# Kafka to Snowflake Integration

This repository contains the project for integrating *Apache Kafka* with *Snowflake* for real-time data streaming and processing. The goal of this project is to set up a seamless data pipeline that streams data from Kafka topics to Snowflake tables for analysis and reporting.

## Project Overview

In this project, we’ve set up *Kafka* as a data streaming platform and integrated it with *Snowflake* for real-time data ingestion. The integration allows messages in Kafka topics to be automatically ingested and stored in Snowflake for further processing and analytics.
